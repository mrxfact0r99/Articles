                <p>I hope you‚Äôre all doing great and continuously gaining knowledge. Today, I want to share the story of how I passed the Certified AppSec Pentester (CAPen) Intermediate Level Exam from the SecOps Group on my first attempt. Let‚Äôs dive in! üöÄ</p>

                <h3>The Journey Begins:</h3>
                <p>About eight months ago, I attended BSides Ahmedabad, one of the biggest hacker conferences, similar to DEFCON, held in different states. Since I‚Äôm from Gujarat, it was organized in Ahmedabad. There, I met many knowledgeable people and gained valuable experiences. You can read about my BSides Ahmedabad visit and takeaways by clicking here: <a href="articles/index-07.html" target="_blank">BSides Ahmedabad Takeaways</a></p>

                <h3>Discovering the Exam Opportunity:</h3>
                <p>During the conference, I received various goodies, including swag, T-shirts, and cards. SecOps Group, a partner of BSides, had a registration banner in the professional area where they offered free vouchers for any of their three exams. All I had to do was scan a QR code and fill out a Google form. After completing the form, I enjoyed the provided lunch and finished the conference.</p>
                <p>A few days later, I received an email from SecOps Group, informing me that I was selected for a free exam voucher for the CAPen exam, which usually costs ‚Ç¨250 and includes one free retake. I was thrilled!</p>

                <h3>Preparation and Challenges:</h3>
                <p>The CAPen exam was relatively new, having been launched about a year prior, so there weren‚Äôt many reviews or available guidance. I was also busy preparing for the CEH Practical exam and bug hunting. However, I also wrote a full story of passing the CEH exam in the first attempt, along with the challenges I faced. You can check it out by clicking here: <a href="articles/index-14.html" target="_blank">My Journey to Passing the CEH Exam</a></p>
                <p>So, I didn‚Äôt have much time to focus on CAPen. However, I just wanted to give the CEH Practical Exam and this CAPen Exam for the job perspective as soon as possible. So, I contacted a few people on LinkedIn who had taken the exam, and they provided some helpful guidance.</p>

                <h3>Resources and Mock Exams:</h3>
                <p>During my search for exam guidance, I found: <a href="https://t.co/ho6z77A5iQ" target="_blank">Mock Exam Resource 1</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@in4inci3le001/capen-mock-exam-writeup-77e49668ffe7" target="_blank">Mock Exam Writeup</a>. Additionally, the SecOps Group offered mock exams for CAPen. I took these mock exams and passed with merit, gaining experience with the question types.</p>

                </div>

                <h3>The Exam Day:</h3>
                <p>After passing the CEH exam, I decided to take the CAPen exam. Since I didn‚Äôt have a quiet space or reliable Wi-Fi at home, I went to my friend‚Äôs house in a nearby village, where he had a personal room and a fast 5G internet connection.</p>

                <h3>Challenges Faced:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Flag Submission Confusion: There was confusion about whether to submit the entire flag (flag{value}) or just the value. The mock exam instructions weren‚Äôt clear, and different people had different advice. SecOps Group should clarify this in both the mock and original exams.</li>
                    <li>Unresponsive Questions: Some questions didn‚Äôt respond to clicks. Thankfully, one of my LinkedIn connections who had taken the exam helped guide me through this issue.</li>
                    <li>Hint Penalty: I completed all the questions and passed with merit. However, for one question, I used a hint, thinking it would only reduce marks for that specific question. Instead, it reduced my overall marks, causing me to lose my merit status. Understanding this penalty system is crucial.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
                <p>Passing the CAPen exam taught me valuable lessons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Clarify instructions: Always ensure you understand the exam instructions clearly.</li>
                    <li>Seek guidance: Don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out to others for advice and support.</li>
                    <li>Learn from mistakes: Every mistake is an opportunity to learn and improve.</li>
                </ul>
